>>>  YOUR ACTION PLAN (Let's fix this!)
================================================================================

STEP 1: [URGENT] IMMEDIATE ACTION: HIGH SPENDING ALERT (UNCATEGORIZED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

[COACH SAYS]:
   "I've noticed a spike in your spending over the last 3 days. You've spent Rs.36,000, mainly on Uncategorized (Rs.21,000).
            
Based on your income, your 'safe' daily spending limit is around Rs.1,167. You've exceeded this significantly recently."

[WHY THIS MATTERS]:
   Getting back on track quickly is the key to financial health. A few days of strict budgeting now prevents a month of stress later.

[ACTION STEPS]:
   [ ] For the next 3 days, try a 'No Spend' challenge. Eat at home, free entertainment only.
   [ ] Check your bank balance. Do you have enough for upcoming fixed bills (Rent, EMI)?
   [ ] Set a daily reminder for the next week: 'Budget left: Rs.1,167'
   [ ] Review the Uncategorized purchase. Was it planned? If not, return it if possible.

[POTENTIAL SAVINGS]: Rs.32,500/month

STEP 2: WHOA - RS.0 ON THIS CATEGORY?!
--------------------------------------

[COACH SAYS]:
   "Okay, let's talk about this category. You spent Rs.0 across 0 transactions. That averages Rs.0 each time!

I'm not saying this category is bad - we all need things. But this is a LOT for one category. Let me put it in perspective: if you cut this by just 20%, that's Rs.0 saved. What could you do with that extra money?"

[WHY THIS MATTERS]:
   High spending in one category means opportunity. This isn't about depriving yourself - it's about being smart with YOUR money. Cut this category spending by 20% and you won't even notice the difference in your life. But you'll definitely notice Rs.0 extra in savings!

[ACTION STEPS]:
   [ ] BUDGET IT: this category gets max Rs.0 next month. Track every rupee in this category.
   [ ] COMPARE PRICES: Before buying, check 3 places/websites. Often 20-30% price difference for same item!
   [ ] BULK BUYING: Can you buy in bulk quarterly instead of monthly? Usually saves 15-20%.
   [ ] QUESTION EVERYTHING: For each this category purchase, ask: 'Is there a cheaper way to get this same result?'
   [ ] TRACK & REDUCE: Each month, try to spend 5% less in this category than last month. Gradual improvement adds up!
